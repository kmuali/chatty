                        Starry Night is a painting by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh <br>
                        from outside the window of his sanatorium room in 1889 .. <br>
                        It was about the night of Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, <br> 
                        though he painted it as day and all his memories of that night he saw. 
                        <br> <br>
                        The painting has been permanently located since 1941 in the Museum of Modern Art, <br>
                        which was built after it was purchased
                        from the Heritage University of American Art. <br>
                        
                        This painting by Vincent van Gogh is among his most famous and represents <br> a crucial turning point due to his use of
                        greater freedom of imagination in his paintings.
